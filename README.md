## Project Overview

**HPVx Navigator** (parent project) is a web‑based navigation tool that guides people to practical, state‑specific pathways for multiple states for getting the free/low-cost human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and community resources for social needs that could help access healthcare services. It delivers clear eligibility screening, step‑by‑step access instructions, and community resource referrals—all written in plain, approachable language. This **State Focus Hub: GA & NC** is a sub-project tailored specifically for Georgia and North Carolina. This GA and NC-specific project is part of the **American Cancer Society's HPV Roundtable Emerging Leaders Program**.

## Intended Impact

HPVx Navigator State Focus Hub: GA & NC reduces structural barriers to HPV vaccination by translating complex eligibility rules and fragmented service information into simple, actionable steps. By integrating social‑needs resources and plain‑language education, the tool supports equitable vaccine uptake—especially among uninsured, under‑insured, and historically underserved populations in the states of Georgia and North Carolina.
